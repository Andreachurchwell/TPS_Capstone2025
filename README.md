TPS Capstone 2025 – Volunteer Weather 🌤️
Volunteer Weather is a sleek weather dashboard built with Python and Tkinter. It fetches real-time weather data and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in a modern, user-friendly interface. Features include interactive maps, charts, and machine learning predictions — all styled with a bold theme that works in both dark and light modes.

🚀 Features
🌡️ Current weather by city (with icons and description)

📅 5-day, 7-day, 10-day, and 16-day forecast options

📍 Interactive map using TkinterMapView and RainViewer radar overlays

🧠 ML-powered temperature predictions (for Selmer, TN)

📊 Temperature trend chart with dark/light mode support

🔁 Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius

💾 Save weather data to CSV and SQLite

🧩 Modular code structure with reusable components

🌘 Splash screen with custom font and styling

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Optional “Team Viewer” dashboard for shared data
