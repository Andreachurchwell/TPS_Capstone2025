Week 15 Reflection
🗓️ Overview
This week wasn’t as heavy on my personal capstone work as usual, but I made real progress on our Team 7 feature. I spent most of the week cleaning and merging data, experimenting with charts, and starting to build out the team dashboard directly inside my main app window.

Also—we officially named our team!
🌀 Team Name: Weather U Like It or Not
Brett came up with it, and we all agreed it totally fits us.

✅ What I Did
👥 Team Feature Work – "Weather U Like It or Not"
Merged the cleaned CSVs from teammates who have turned in their data (me, Brett, Luis, and Mark).

Standardized the columns to our agreed format:
date, city, min_temp, max_temp, precip, max_wind_speed

Started playing around with Matplotlib chart ideas and experimenting with how the team’s data could be visualized.

Added a Team Viewer button to my weather app that renders the dashboard directly inside the main window instead of opening a popup.

Created a Back button that takes the user back to the main home screen layout.

🔧 Capstone (Volunteer Weather)
Didn’t do as much this week on the core capstone features.

Still brainstorming layout ideas and will pick it back up once the team feature is in a good place.

🌀 Challenges
Felt slower this week than usual and had trouble staying focused on my personal app.

Waiting on a couple teammates' CSVs caused some delays in testing the full team dashboard.

✅ Wins
Making the team dashboard render inside my main window felt like a huge step.

Felt more confident working with pandas and Matplotlib while experimenting with data and visuals.

Happy with our team name and how well we’re collaborating overall.

🎯 Goals for Next Week
Finalize the charts and dropdowns for the team dashboard (city and month selection).

Get back to polishing my capstone UI and fixing leftover bugs.

Practice a few timed Python challenges to prepare for the Aug 5th skills check.
