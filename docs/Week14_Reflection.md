Week 14 Reflection ‚Äì From Forecast Failures to Fresh Fixes üå©Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏è
This week was full of ups and downs. It started out rough ‚Äî my forecast buttons (especially 7-day, 10-day, and 16-day) were acting up, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out if the issue was on my end or something going on with OpenWeather. The app was freezing, my forecast popups were missing info, and I was starting to worry I'd have to undo days of work.

Eventually, I tracked the issue down to how I was handling the selected city coordinates. My app was defaulting to ‚ÄúSelmer‚Äù unless the user typed in a new city, even if they had already selected one. Once I fixed that, the forecasts worked again and the popups started behaving like they should.

During Asha‚Äôs office hour, she helped guide me through a much-needed improvement to my live radar setup. Instead of using a dropdown menu in the main window (which was clunky and limited), I moved all my tile layers (radar, clouds, wind, etc.) directly into the Leaflet-based popup using checkboxes. That update made the radar feature more powerful and user-friendly, and it cleaned up my UI at the same time.

Another win this week was finally getting serious about Git hygiene. I set up my .gitignore properly to exclude sensitive files like my API key text file and my local database. I also used git rm --cached to stop tracking weather.db, which made me feel way more confident about pushing to GitHub without risking security or clutter.

On the visual side, I added a new temp_trend_chart.py file that drops a mini trend chart into my main window. It's a good start, but it definitely still needs work to look polished and dynamic. I also started setting up a moon phase test file and have a few other features in progress that I want to clean up soon.

I also recorded a Loom walkthrough video this week to explain how my app works. At first, I struggled with getting the mic and screen settings to work, but once I got it figured out, I was able to walk through the key features: the current weather display, forecast buttons, live radar integration, and some of the visuals I‚Äôve been working on. Making the video actually helped me realize how much progress I‚Äôve made ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a good practice run for my final presentation.

All in all, it was a chaotic but productive week. I hit some roadblocks, but I didn‚Äôt panic. I worked through them, asked for help when I needed it, and learned a lot ‚Äî especially about debugging, explaining my work clearly, and managing a clean Git workflow.
