# Week 16 Reflection – Capstone Project

This week was a big milestone — wrapping up the main development of my Volunteer Weather app and getting ready for the final demo. It’s been a mix of relief, excitement, and nerves, but also a lot of focus on making sure everything flows.

## Wins
- Finished integrating the machine learning temperature prediction for Selmer, TN directly into the main window.
- Cleaned up the UI to match the final color scheme and font choices.
- Improved theme consistency between dark and light modes.
- Successfully tested all core features: autocomplete city search, extended forecasts, live radar, charts, and team dashboard.
- Completed my Canva slide deck and added a Loom video of my demo as backup.

## Challenges
- Debugging the ML prediction display took longer than expected, especially with layout alignment.
- Keeping consistent styling across multiple popups and sections.
- Balancing time between polishing the app and creating slides/Looms.
- Fighting the urge to add last-minute “just one more” features.

## Lessons Learned
- Modular code structure really pays off when making final changes under time pressure.
- Practicing the demo multiple times made me way more confident.
- Sometimes “done” is better than “perfect,” especially before a deadline.

## Next Steps
- Final run-through of the slides and demo before presentation day.
- Make sure the Loom backup plays correctly, just in case.
- Take a breather after presentation day — it’s been a long 16 weeks!
